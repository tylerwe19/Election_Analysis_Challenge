### Election Audit Summary ###
  The current script is already in good shape to analyze and summarize data from elections in other districts and broader state/nation-wide elections. If a broader state wide election was conducted and officials wanted to breakdown results by precinct/district, then another column would need to be added to identify the precinct/distrcit. Similarly with a nationwide election, a state column would need to be added to identify the results by state. I think it would also be interesting to breakdown results by whether a citizen submitted a ballot the day of the election or mailed in their ballot.
